# Test 1R: Standard Mechanics with Selection Principles

## Background: Physical Selection Principles

When working with Lagrangian mechanics and physics discovery, keep in mind these fundamental selection principles that nature follows:

1. **Principle of Least Action**: Physical systems follow paths that minimize (or make stationary) the action S = ∫L dt. This is not just a computational trick but a fundamental principle of how nature operates.

2. **Local Gauge Invariance**: Valid physical theories maintain local symmetries. The Lagrangian should be invariant under appropriate gauge transformations, which constrains the form of physical interactions.

3. **Renormalizability**: Physical theories must remain predictive at all energy scales. In 4D spacetime, this typically means the Lagrangian should contain operators of dimension ≤ 4.

## Task

Given the Lagrangian:
L = (1/2)m*ẋ² - V(x)

Questions:
1. Apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to derive the equation of motion
2. Identify what physical principle this Lagrangian respects (relate to the selection principles above)
3. Explain why this is a valid classical Lagrangian

Show all steps clearly.
