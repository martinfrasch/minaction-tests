# Test 5: Reverse Engineering (Inverse Problem)

You observe a physical system following the equation of motion:
ẍ = -ω²*x

Your task: Propose a Lagrangian L(x, ẋ, t) that would give rise to this 
equation of motion via the Euler-Lagrange equation.

Explain your reasoning and verify that your proposed Lagrangian produces 
the correct equation of motion.
