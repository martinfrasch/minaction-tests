# Test 3: Novel Lagrangian with Random Coefficients

Given a Lagrangian with coefficients you've never seen before:

L = 3.7*x² - 2.1*ẋ² + 1.4*x*ẋ

Apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to derive the equation of motion.

This tests whether you can apply variational calculus to novel mathematical 
structures, or if you're just pattern-matching from training data.

Show all steps clearly.
